              <p className="lead">I am currently a PHP Developer at <a href="https://somersetdesign.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somerset Design</a>.</p>
              <p className="lead">Previously, I worked as a Technical Specialist for <a href="https://mondago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mondago Ltd</a>, where I covered two roles: Web Developer and Product Specialist.</p>
              <p className="lead">As a Web Developer (using technologies like AJAX, jQuery, Laravel, PHP, and SQL), I took care of all the public websites, the company's Business System, and most of the internal online systems.</p>
              <p className="lead">
                I also dedicated part of my time at the company to the Product Specialist role, where I covered the Italian market, providing sales and technical support.
                The role granted me the opportunity to attend <a href="#wheres-waldo" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#wheres-waldo">conferences</a> and events in different countries.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">Outside of the office, you are most likely to find me at a caf√® trying to speak a new foreign language, or chasing <a href="#classic-cars" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#classic-cars">classic cars</a> in the streets of town.</p>
